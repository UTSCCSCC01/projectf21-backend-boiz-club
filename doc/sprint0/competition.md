Competitive Analysis

The project will primarily target younger people -- young adults to middle-aged people. The priority is aimed towards students since they are more likely to own
pets during their time in university. The project is also suitable for young people who have a really stable job and travel often, so that they can leave their
pets to somebody else while they are away.

There is currently one popular product called Rover (https://www.rover.com), which is quite similar to what Pawsup is doing. However, there are several differences:

1. Rover is geared more towards the United States. While Rover has customers from other countries such as Germany, Spain, and Canada, their customers are mainly
from the United States. In particular, Rover does not have a significant number of customers from Canada. On the other hand, Pawsup is planning to focus on the 
Greater Toronto Area right now, and it will expand from there to many different areas in Canada. 

2. Rover does not offer anything else other than services. In particular, it does not have a dedicated pets store. Pawsup, on the other hand, has a store to 
accommodate food, supplies, and treats. 

3. Currently, Rover only allows cats and dogs for their services. On the other hand, Pawsup is open to a wide variety of animals, instead of being limited to
only cats and dogs. 

4. Rover only supports English as the only language used in the website. However, Pawsup is currently available in English and Chinese, and it is probably going to 
expand to more languages in the future. 

We think that Rover focuses mostly on United States simply because the company was started there. Theoretically, Rover can easily take over Canada too,
but at the moment that does not seem to be their top priority. This is good news, since Pawsup is planning to get into the market really soon. Hence, when Rover
wants to expand more towards Canada in the future, the majority of users will already use Pawsup, which makes them less likely to switch to Rover all of sudden.
Furthermore, Rover does not offer any products other than services because of their dedicated focus on services. Pawsup definitely needs to be careful, since Rover 
can start adding a pet store in the near future. In addition, Rover primarily focuses on cats and dogs since those two animals seem to be the most popular across the United States. While that also holds true in Canada, Pawsup wants to stand out by giving more freedom to the customers in terms of the type of services and pets. While Rover could easily accept other animals, it seems very unlikely due to their restricted nature which clearly sets a limit on the range of services and the type of pets. Finally, Rover only supports English because the majority of United States' residents speak English. On the other hand, Canada is a very diverse 
country which naturally demands more variety of languages to be supported.
