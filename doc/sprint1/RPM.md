## Release Goal
At the meeting, it was discussed that the four epics we had created are of utmost importance for our release.
These epics include **Auth** (BAC-7), **Admin** (BAC-25), **Service/Product** (BAC-23), and **Account** (BAC-24).

The prioritization of these epics is as follows: **Auth**, **Admin**, **Service/Product**, and **Account**.

### **Auth (BAC-7)**
The epic **Auth** was prioritized as all issues under the epic were discussed to be vital to the first sprint. Some of the important user stories discussed were the ability for users to create an account (BAC-1), log-in (BAC-2), log-out (BAC-22), and reset  password (BAC-3). 

Our logic for making **Auth** that most important epic is because the user is at the heart of literally every operation that occurs on the platform. So if we finished and fine-tuned user management first it would make development much easier down the line.

### **Admin(BAC-25)**

As a team, we decided to prioritize next the epic **Admin**. This includes the ability for users to upload their government identification for account verification (BAC-6). Consequently, we also decided to prioritize the ability for an **administrator** to approve or decline user's requests for  verification based on their uploaded identification (BAC-41). 

This epic was prioritized because the product owner's stressed the importance of the role an admin plays in the ecosystem. Users cannot purchase/sell services until they are verified which happens at the hands of an admin. In a sense, the admin is a gatekeeper for many services offered on the site and thus it is crucial it's finished earlier rather then later.

### **Service/Product (BAC-23)**

Some services include the ability to list a service (BAC-12), purchase services through the app (BAC-10), search for nearby available services (BAC-4) and much more. Products include the selling of goods like dog food, toys, and much more on the site (BAC-14).

Services are at the heart of what Pawsup is all about and you may be wondering why it is further down the pipeline? Well simply in order for services to work as attended the previous two epics are required to be completed to enable smooth development of these features.

### **Account (BAC-24)**

Finally we have dedicated our team towards the development of a robust, creative, and interactive user account. These features include allowing users to modify their personal information (BAC-5), contact other service owners (BAC-11),  sending users confirmation emails for their purchases (BAC-19), and much more.

This epic has been prioritized last because these features are not necessary for the app but would be extremely nice to have. For example, having an interactive built-in messaging feature would be extremely useful to users but not absolutely essential to the release of the product.
